# Owersite

Owersite is an open-source script written in python just for fun. It doesn't have too many features but in my free time i'll work on script and i'll add new features, ofcourse you can download project and you can change it as much as you want and if you have better idea how should some features work you can fork project and i'll be happy to see new ideas.

## Features

Current features of project, in future i'll add more features to make project better and more funnier!

```bash
✔️ Opening any website by url
✔️ Moveing cursor to random positions on screen
✔️ Spam clicking left and right mouse button clicks
✔️ Spamming sentences and spamming enter button on keyboard
✔️ Change background
✔️ Running vbs script that spams error msg box with random symbols
```
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyautogui module. That is the only module that you should install through cmd/terminal.

```bash
pip install pyautogui
pip install requests
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run script you need to open cmd/terminal and write following command

```python
python app.py
```

## Supported OS

This script is currently being developed only for Windows but some of features still work on Linux. Features that work on linux are: Move cursor, spammsg, clicking, openwebsite. In future I'll add more Linux features so fun would be equal on every OS!

## Current version and release notes

Current version of this project is v1.0.5 in this version i added changing background and spamming error vbs script with random symbols!

## Note

Script is made only for fun and I (author of project AKA charon) am not responsible for any possible harming changes that people might add by forking project. Run other forks on your own risk!
