Startup feature only works for Windows 8 and 10 becuase they have the same way of setting script to run automaticaly on startup.
If you want to "disable" startup feature just remove few lines of code that are marked with comments in code.
Windows 7 or older versions wont have startup feature I will not include that feature for old versions because people dont use that versions and it is useless!1
